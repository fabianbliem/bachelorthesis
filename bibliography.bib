abstract = {A microscopic two-level simulation modeling framework is proposed to analyze both decision-making processes at a crosswalk as well as physical interactions among pedestrians when they cross a street. The model at the higher level is based on Decision Field Theory to represent the psychological preferences of pedestrians with respect to different route choice options during their deliberation process after evaluating current surroundings. At the lower level, physical interactions among pedestrians and consequent congestions are represented using a Cellular Automata model, in which pedestrians are allowed biased random-walking without back step towards their destination that has been given by the higher level model. A typical crosswalk with split sidewalks in the Chicago Loop area is employed as a case study, which has been implemented in AnyLogic{\textregistered} software. Weekday pedestrian counts on the 15-min basis near the studied crosswalk have been collected and used to construct and validate the simulation models. Experiments have been conducted to investigate the impact of corresponding environment parameters, such as pedestrian types and green/red phase length, as well as social parameters such as leadership in group decision making, on the average pedestrian waiting time at the crosswalk. Initial results look quite interesting. An extension on coupling the proposed pedestrian model with a transportation simulation model is also briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding and modelling route choice behaviour is central to predicting the formation and propagation of urban road congestion. Yet within conventional literature disagreements persist around the nature of route choice behaviour, and how it should be modelled. In this paper, both the shortest path and anchor-based perspectives on route choice behaviour are explored through an empirical analysis of nearly 700,000 minicab routes across London, United Kingdom. In the first set of analyses, the degree of similarity between observed routes and possible shortest paths is established. Shortest paths demonstrate poor performance in predicting both observed route choice and characteristics. The second stage of analysis explores the influence of specific urban features, named anchors, in route choice. These analyses show that certain features attract more route choices than would be expected were individuals choosing route based on cost minimisation alone. Instead, the results indicate that major urban features form the basis of route choice planning - being selected disproportionately more often, and causing asymmetry in route choice volumes by direction of travel. At a finer scale, decisions made at minor road features are furthermore demonstrated to influence routing patterns. The results indicate a need to revisit the basis of how routes are modelled, shifting from the shortest path perspective to a mechanism structured around urban features. In concluding, the main trends are synthesised within an initial framework for route choice modelling, and presents potential extensions of this research.},

This paper presents an end-to-end solution based on the Google Cloud Platform with scalable processing capability to deal with large volumes of traffic camera data across the UK in a cost-efficient manner. It describes a deep learning pipeline to detect pedestrians and vehicles and to generate mobility statistics from these. It includes novel methods for data cleaning and post-processing using a Structure SImilarity Measure (SSIM)-based static mask that improves reliability and accuracy in classifying people and vehicles from traffic camera images. The solution resulted in statistics describing trends in the ‘busyness' of various towns and cities in the UK. We validated time series against Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras across North East England, showing a close correlation between our statistical output and the ANPR source. Trends were also favorably compared against traffic flow statistics from the UK's Department of Transport. The results of this work have been adopted as an experimental faster indicator of the impact of COVID-19 on the UK economy and society by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).},

This study discusses the effects of pedestrian accessibility, connectivity and continuity on tourists' walking experience based on their expectations and satisfaction of the pedestrian networks. The study focused on the historical district of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Data were gathered from questionnaire survey conducted with 330 respondents, who were tourists walking in the area. The study demonstrated that tourists' expectations on the spatial characteristics of walkways in terms of accessibility, connectivity and continuity were greater than their satisfaction. The tourists' satisfaction relates strongly to diverse street usages and activities. The findings of the study will be a useful reference for planners and urban designers in providing walkable places to support urban tourism activities.},

A total of 317 pedestrians were involved in the questionnaire survey at the three different sidewalk locations. The result shows significant differences in mean satisfaction value between male and female pedestrians. Female pedestrian give lower satisfaction value for overall travel experience at Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman but higher satisfaction value at Petaling Street and Bukit Bintang compared to male pedestrian. Overall, the satisfaction level was rated between acceptable to satisfactory regardless of gender differences. Improvements should be made for the safety parameter because both male and female pedestrian gives lowest satisfaction level in that area.},

The present study examines the relationships between pedestrian satisfaction, and a variety of built environment factors, in order to gain insight into urban design strategies that can improve pedestrian satisfaction. We analyzed a pedestrian survey, carried out in Seoul, Korea, which includes questions about personal characteristics, micro-scale environmental attributes, and the level of pedestrian satisfaction, together with Seoul GIS data, which provided meso-scale environmental variables. The multilevel models estimated the effects of environmental factors on the level of satisfaction of utilitarian and recreational walkers. The analysis identified significant effects of both meso-scale (e.g. density, intersection density, hilliness, and the presence of bus stops), and micro-scale (e.g. sidewalk width, and the presence of bus dedicated lanes, crossings, lamps, and trees) variables on pedestrian satisfaction. The results calls on researchers to investigate a comprehensive set of psychological and environmental factors, in order to understand the various aspects of pedestrian satisfaction, and the diverse motivations behind it, as well as on planners, to adopt diverse design approaches that will produce more satisfactory pedestrian environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this regard this study aimed at developing PLOS models for three pedestrian facilities such as sidewalk, signalized intersection and un-signalized intersection by using qualitative data sets. Total 2730 pedestrian's real time sense of satisfaction data were collected from ten cities of India. Behavioral responses were taken in order to assess variation with different age and gender from study areas having miscellaneous activities. Taking sets of questions, different variable scores were estimated to provide a wide variation of independent variable that will be more reliable for model fitting. Before model development degree of dependency has been examined with the help of discriminant factor analysis. Implementing ridge regression technique three different PLOS models have been developed for three pedestrian facilities. PLOS scores found by using the proposed models were classified by applying GA-Fuzzy clustering technique in order to get six PLOS ranges (A-F). At signalized intersection 3% of participants were extremely dissatisfied with the facility and they gave rating of >5 for PLOS score. This high score was because of pedestrian speed was severely restricted at some places due to the left and permissible right turning vehicles. Results also revealed that for un-signalized intersection nearly 23% of participants were having PLOS score of >4 as waiting time was more than expected and also pedestrian had to face conflict with vehicles while crossing.},

abstract = {In moving pedestrian crowds, the distribution of individuals over different available routes emerges from the decisions of individuals that may be influenced by the actions of others. Understanding this phenomenon not only is important for research into collective behaviour, but also has practical applications for building safety and event management. Here, we study the mechanisms underlying pedestrian route choice, focusing on how time-independent information, such as path lengths, and time-dependent information, such as queue lengths, affect both initial decisions and subsequent changes in route choices. We address these questions using experiments with nearly 140 volunteers and an individual-based model for route choice. Crucially, we consider a wide range of route choice scenarios. We find that initial route choices of pedestrians achieve a balanced usage of available routes. Our model suggests that pedestrians performing trade-offs between exit widths and predicted exit crowdedness can explain this emergent distribution in many contexts. Few pedestrians adjust their route choice in our experiments. Simulations suggest that these decisions could be explained by pedestrians comparing estimates of the time it would take them to reach their target using different routes. Route choice is complex, but our findings suggest that conceptually simple behaviours may explain many movement decisions.},

A questionnaire survey was used to record opinions of respondents hailing from diverse socio-economic backgrounds on trip number and mode preferences for a variety of trip purposes for “before” and “during” COVID-19 situation. This was used to assess changes in (i) trip frequencies, and (ii) travel mode preferences using contingency tables, ordinal logistic regression and Sankey diagrams. Analyses revealed that COVID-19 caused large variation in mode preferences but small variation in trip frequencies. Males still go outside for work and shopping, putting them at greater risk than females. COVID-19 has drastically cut recreational trips, but not so many work trips. Although online work or education (950) and shopping (170) has risen, this seems to be limited to urban areas. Besides, buses continue to be preferred the most during pandemic for trips involving short distance recreation (26.75), markets (43.18), and long distance recreation (35.66). Results suggest the lack of online penetration in rural and suburban areas have prevented worktrip reductions in those places, putting the inhabitants at heightened risk from virus. Moreover, majority of the people continue to use buses at the expense of their health for lack of cheaper alternatives. Results imply that the government needs to ensure proper hygiene practices in public transit and non-motorised paratransit vehicles. Moreover, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), pedestrian and bicycle facilities need to be improved.},

In doing so, this study discerns students' satisfaction with their selection of the shortest or non-shortest route and which environmental factors and behavioral characteristics influenced their selection and satisfaction.

abstract = {Pedestrian route choice, the process by which individuals decide on their walking path between two locations, is a fundamental problem across disciplines. Because this behaviour is investigated from different conceptual and methodological angles, and because it strongly depends on the environmental context, it is challenging to establish a systematic framework for research. Here, by reviewing previous work, we identify four principles for pedestrian route choice that are relevant across disciplines. First, ‘information perception' deals with how pedestrians can perceive information selectively and purposely, given the limited available information. Second, ‘information integration' considers how pedestrians subjectively integrate environmental spatial information into mental representations. Third, ‘responding to information' is concerned with how pedestrians tend to be attracted and repelled by specific attributes individually and how this can lead to positive or negative feedback loops across many individuals. Fourth ‘decision-making mechanisms' describe how pedestrians trade off the evidence provided by different attributes. How pedestrians perceive, integrate, respond to, and act upon information is not fixed but varies with the context. We give examples for each principle and explain how these principles shape pedestrian choice behaviours. We hope this contribution provides a systematic overview of the field and helps to spark inspiration among specialists.},

abstract = {Knowledge mining from the historical traffic big data is absolutely necessary for future intelligent transportation system (ITS) and smart city. Mining traffic data is a challenging task that can be used for traffic forecasting and improving traffic flow. In this paper, we explore and analyse the historical traffic big data to extract the informative patterns. Three years (2013 to 2015) real traffic data was collected from the city of Porto, Portugal. We developed a Java based traffic data observation (TDO) tool for visualising traffic data, which can filter and extract expressive patterns from the traffic big data based on input features. Then, graphs are generated by TDO from the traffic data to find the historical averages of traffic flow. Finally, we have applied regression models: Linear Regression, Sequential Minimal Optimisation (SMO) Regression, and M5 Base Regression Tree on the traffic data to find annual average daily traffic (AADT) and compare their results. Also, we have used regression trees to find the traffic patterns. The goal is to find the abnormal traffic patterns from the historical traffic big data and analyse them to improve the traffic management system (TMS).},

The present study applied the PRISMA framework to systematically identify published studies on PRC. The identified studies were synthesized by answering the systematic classification scheme (SCS) questions. Results show that prior studies have used a total of 105 factors associated with PRC. The identified factors were categorized under three groups (i.e. pedestrian socio-demographic factors, built environment factors, trip characteristics). The findings of this systematic review identified several critical research gaps for studying PRC behaviour. Future PRC research should aim to determine the influence of social, physical, and individual factors associated with PRC and the nature of the relationships of those factors with PRC.},

Conducted in a strategic area, the survey, as often is the case, collects data that are skewed and face the separation issue—the same outcome always occurs for a particular value of a predictor—according to which estimates by the conventional maximum likelihood (ML) method are inflated. Thus, one mechanical and one statistical alternative are employed: (1) exclusion of a variable that causes separation and (2) estimation by Firth's penalized method. The two alternatives produce comparable results of the significance testing, that is, p values, but their coefficient estimates considerably differ inasmuch as the mechanical approach used for the ML logistic regression forcefully omits the important variable and subsequently biases the estimates of other predictors. Compared to these ML estimates, empirical findings from the Firth logistic regression are presented in a way that corrects for the ML bias.},

This study presents an investigation into pedestrians' routing behaviours within an indoor environment under normal, non-panic situations. A network-based method using constrained Delaunay triangulation is adopted, and a utility-based model employing dynamic programming is developed. The main contribution of this study is the formulation of an appropriate utility function that allows an effective application of dynamic programming to predict a series of consecutive waypoints within a built environment. The aim is to generate accurate sequence waypoints for the pedestrian walking path using only structural definitions of the environment as defined in a standard CAD format. The simulation results are benchmarked against those from the A* algorithm, and the outcome positively indicates the usefulness of the proposed method in predicting pedestrians' route selection activities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, there are more alternative links available to pedestrians between a given origin-destination (O-D) pair. This paper describes a study done by the University of Calgary to evaluate the factors affecting the choice of route on intra-CBD trips or trips within the Central Business District (CBD). An origin destination survey conducted in downtown Calgary, Alberta enabled the identification of the most significant factors influencing the choice. These factors were analyzed in relation to the physical characteristics of the location, personal characteristics of the trip maker and the type of the trip. It appears that most people chose the shortest link and factors such as the level of congestion, safety or visual attractions were only secondary. This suggests that the length should be made a major consideration when planning and designing pedestrian links. {\textcopyright} 1985, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Does infrastructure shape human behavior, or does human behavior shape infrastructure? Users' perception about infrastructure, both current condition and future needs, is essential in devising policy decisions. In the transport sector, one of the reasons of several large infrastructure projects being either delayed or not living up to expectations once they are built, is because the users are not taken into confidence sufficiently. At the same time, it is uncertain to what extent user perception leads to actual behavior change-how many people that say today will walk more if walking environment is improved, will actual do so when the facility is built? The current research measures the users' satisfaction of present walking environment using a revealed preference survey on factors that include quality of infrastructure, comfort, safety, design, and others, in two different urban settings of a large metropolis-one a newly planned suburb and the other and older and well established area. Results of an ordinal logistic regression model shows that the factors which are likely to significantly influence the overall user satisfaction of pedestrian facilities are buffer, ease of walking, zebra crossings, footpath continuity, night time safety and location. Subsequently, stated preference data was collected and the results of a negative binomial regression model shows that improving footpath continuity has the greatest impact in the likelihood of bringing about a change in user behavior when compared to not only other individual improvements, but also the combined improvement in buffer and ease of walking.},

However, in the Transportation Planning and Engineering domain it is still infrequent to find in the travel behavior literature studies using qualitative techniques to explore activity-travel decisions. The aim of this paper is first, to provide an overview of the types of qualitative techniques available and to explore how to correctly implement them. Secondly, to highlight the special characteristics of qualitative methods that makes them appropriate to study activity-travel decision processes. Far from been an unempirical or intuitive methodology, using qualitative methods properly implies a strong foundation on theoretical frameworks, a careful design of data collection and a deep data analysis. For such a purpose, a review of the scarce activity-travel behavior literature using qualitative methods, or a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches, is presented. The use of qualitative techniques can play a role of being a supplementary way of obtaining information related to activity-travel decisions that otherwise it would be extremely difficult to find. This work ends with some conclusions about how qualitative research could help in making progress on activity-travel behavior studies.},

We study the impact of various street attributes known to affect pedestrian route choice from prior literature. Unlike most studies, where data has been constrained to a particular destination type (e.g. walking to transit stations) or limited in volume, a large number of actual trajectories presented here include a wide diversity of destinations and geographies, allowing us to describing typical pedestrians' preferences in San Francisco as a whole. Other innovations presented in the paper include using a novel technique for generating alternative paths for route choice estimation and gathering previously hard-to-get route attribute information by computationally processing a large set of Google Street View images. We also demonstrate how the estimated coefficients can be operationalized for policy and planning to describe pedestrian accessibility to BART stations in San Francisco using ‘perceived distance' as opposed to traversed distance.},

abstract = {Among the most interesting and challenging theoretical and practical problems in describing pedestrians behavior are route choice and activity scheduling. Compared to other modes of transport, a characteristic feature of pedestrian route choice is that routes are continuous trajectories in time and space: since a pedestrian chooses a route from an infinite set of alternatives, dedicated theories and models describing pedestrian route choice are required.This article puts forward a new theory of pedestrian behavior under uncertainty based on the concept of utility maximization. The main behavioral assumption is that pedestrians optimize some predicted pedestrian-specific utility function, representing a trade-off between the utility gained from performing activities at a specific location, and the predicted cost of walking subject to the physical limitations of the pedestrians and the kinematics of the pedestrian. The uncertainty reflects the randomness of the experienced traffic conditions.Based on this normative theory, route choice, activity area choice, and activity scheduling are simultaneously optimized using dynamic programming for different traffic conditions and uncertainty levels. Throughout the article, the concepts are illustrated by examples. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is the modelling of a decision process that takes place on the tactical level of a pedestrian's trip. The tactical level is defined in delimitation to the superior strategic level and subordinated operational level with respect to trip purpose and spatial relations. Whereas on the strategic level the purpose, the origin and destination, the choices for traffic mode and time of departure are being set before the trip starts, on the tactical level, decisions are being made for the actual route or diversions within the pedestrian's network during the trip. At the tactical level, the decision making process can be modelled by the minimisation problem of walking costs in a network that takes into account both the network related quality and individual related factors. In the paper, the concept of a pedestrian quality attribute and its evaluation by physical assessable factors are introduced. In order to enable the application of the model, it is assumed that experiences in principle are gained by the walking pedestrian from prior knowledge of the walking network. This is the essential precondition for the decision making process that is based on a conventional route search algorithm. Instead the routing decisions by pedestrians are drawn in a mental process during walking that is characterised as non-formalistic. The purpose of the formalistic approach described in the text is to help understand the influencing factors and mechanisms of the decision making process in the analysis of pedestrian quality needs.},

Thus, current cities need to be redeveloped towards less use of carbon in their day to day operations. Pedestrianized environment is one of the approaches used in reducing carbon foot print in cities. Heritage cities are the first to be looked into since they were built in the era in which motorized vehicles were minimal. Therefore, the research explores users' satisfaction on assessment of physical attributes of pedestrianization in Melaka Historical City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It aims to examine users' satisfaction on pedestrian facilities provided within the study area using pair wise questionnaire comparison approach. A survey of 200 respondents using random sampling was conducted in six different sites namely Jonker Street, Church Street, Kota Street, Goldsmith Street, Merdeka Street to Taming Sari Tower and Merdeka Street to River Cruise terminal. The survey consists of an assessment tool based on a nine-point scale of users' satisfaction level of pathway properties, zebra pedestrian crossing, street furniture, personal safety, adjacent to traffic flow, aesthetic and amenities. Analytical hierarchical process (AHP) was used to avoid any biasness in analyzing the data collected. Findings show that Merdeka Street to Taming Sari Tower as the street that scores the highest satisfaction level that fulfils all the required needs of a pedestrianized environment. Similar assessment elements can be used to evaluate existing streets in other cities and these criteria should also be used in planning for future cities. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Total 2730 pedestrian's real time sense of satisfaction data were collected from ten cities of India. Behavioral responses were taken in order to assess variation with different age and gender from study areas having miscellaneous activities. Taking sets of questions, different variable scores were estimated to provide a wide variation of independent variable that will be more reliable for model fitting. Before model development degree of dependency has been examined with the help of discriminant factor analysis. Implementing ridge regression technique three different PLOS models have been developed for three pedestrian facilities. PLOS scores found by using the proposed models were classified by applying GA-Fuzzy clustering technique in order to get six PLOS ranges (A-F). At signalized intersection 3% of participants were extremely dissatisfied with the facility and they gave rating of >5 for PLOS score. This high score was because of pedestrian speed was severely restricted at some places due to the left and permissible right turning vehicles. Results also revealed that for un-signalized intersection nearly 23% of participants were having PLOS score of >4 as waiting time was more than expected and also pedestrian had to face conflict with vehicles while crossing.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a survey of pedestrian trips to transit that examined the trip lengths and route choices made by people walking to five rail transit stations in California and Oregon. In highly motorized countries such as the US, policy-makers are beginning to recognize that shifting some travel from auto trips to walking trips can help the country achieve important policy objectives such as combating obesity and reducing the air pollution and oil dependency that result from auto use. However, researchers know very little about pedestrian behaviour and the role of the built and aesthetic environment in influencing pedestrian trips to transit. As communities wrestle with the interconnected issues of obesity, sprawl, and quality of life, planners need to understand how far Americans will walk to transit and the environmental factors that influence them. This survey of 328 pedestrians walking to rail stations, primarily on weekday mornings, found that they were willing to walk an average of half a mile to the rail station and that minimizing the distance walked was the most important factor influencing their choice of route. The people surveyed also frequently mentioned safety factors as important in route choice. Aesthetic elements of the built environment, on the other hand, were rarely mentioned as important route choice factors. The paper concludes by using these survey findings to recommend strategies that planners, designers, and policy-makers can use to design successful transit and pedestrian-oriented developments.},

abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic mixed discrete-continuous choice approach to modeling pedestrian travel and activity choice behavior in public facilities. The approach views revealed behavior as a manifestation of pedestrians' preferences by assuming that pedestrians choose the alternative that maximizes expected (subjective) utility, while taking into account the uncertainty in expected traffic conditions. The choice dimensions are trajectories between origin and subsequent destinations, areas where activities are performed (multiple vs. fixed destination), execution of discretionary activities, and finally activities completion times and order. The disutility of a trajectory determines the trajectory choice of the traveler. Destination area choice is included in the modeling by determining time-dependent and destination-specific arrival costs. Furthermore, penalties for not executing a planned activity are introduced into the modeling framework. The resulting modeling approach has a clear analogy with stochastic control theory and dynamic programming in continuous time and space. The main innovations presented here is the relaxation of the assumption that routes are discrete sets of travel links. The approach relaxes the need to build a discrete network, while routes (trajectories) are continuous functions in time and space. At the same time, destination choice is included in the modeling framework. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to understand and quantify better the influence of the overall level of service (LOS) of the urban walking environment on pedestrian route choice behavior. A methodology for estimating the overall LOS of pedestrian walkways and crosswalks was developed on the basis of the concept of total utility value, which comes from a stated preference survey. Each sidewalk and crosswalk link was assigned an overall LOS according to its operational and geometric characteristics determined from field measurements. For analysis of pedestrian behavior, this study used data from a revealed preference survey on individual route choice behavior. A geographic information system network database was used to store the characteristics of the routes that pedestrians used. Network analysis with the ArcGIS program was used to analyze the routes, which included determination of the shortest-path routes and the optimized-LOS-path routes between origin-destination pairs. A comparative analysis of the actual routes and the estimated alternative routes was performed. On the basis of the results, a multinomial logit model was developed to express the route choice behaviors of pedestrians quantitatively. The model results indicate that pedestrians choose routes not only for distance but also for the overall LOS of sidewalks and crosswalks. On longer travel paths, pedestrians divert from the shortest-path route and are found to use sidewalks and crosswalks with high LOS. On shorter routes, pedestrians tend not to avoid sidewalks or crosswalks with low LOS. This analysis suggests that efforts to accommodate pedestrians in urban areas should focus on improving the walking environment of the road network.},

However, it does not comprehensively address pedestrian operations and does not consider some recent important findings such as pedestrian-vehicle interactions at crosswalks, pedestrian signal compliance rate, pedestrian jaywalking behavior, etc. This paper provides an overview of the literature on pedestrian operations in urban networks, identifies the important aspects of pedestrian operation analysis and provides several recommendations for enhancing the analysis of pedestrian facilities in the HCM on the basis of a summary of available U.S. and international literature. The following topics are discussed: pedestrian movement models, pedestrian crossing behavior, pedestrianvehicle interactions. Pedestrian travel time estimation at the path level is proposed as an integrated approach for pedestrian operation analysis.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the validity of first-order traffic flow theory for the description of two-dimensional pedestrian flow operations in the case of an oversaturated bottleneck in front of which a large high-density region has formed. The paper shows how observations of density, speed, and flow that have been collected from laboratory walking experiments can be interpreted from the viewpoint of first-order theory. It is observed that pedestrians present at the same cross section inside of the congested region may encounter different flow conditions. This mainly depends on the lateral position of the pedestrian with respect to the center of the congested region. In the lateral center, high densities and low speeds are observed. However, on the boundary of the congested region, pedestrians may walk in nearly free-flow conditions and literally walk around this congested region. Visualization of these data in the flow - density plane results in a large scatter of points that have similar flows (bottleneck capacity) but different densities. This can be explained by noticing that observations of congestion of pedestrian traffic over the total width of the cross section do not belong to a single fundamental diagram but belong to a set of different fundamental diagrams. This observation has consequences for estimation of the fundamental diagram describing pedestrian traffic.},

abstract = {This contribution puts forward a novel multi-class continuum model that captures some of the key dynamic features of pedestrian flows. It considers route choice behaviour on both the strategic (pre-trip) and tactical (en-route) level. To achieve this, we put forward a class-specific equilibrium direction relation of the pedestrians, which is governed by two parts: one part describing the global route choice, which is pre-determined based on the expectations of the pedestrians, and one part describing the local route choice, which is a density-gradient dependent term that reflects local adaptations based on prevailing flow conditions. Including the local route choice term in the multi-class model causes first of all dispersion of the flow: pedestrians will move away from high density areas in order to reduce their overall walking costs. Second of all, for the crossing flow and bi-directional flow cases, local route choice causes well known self-organised patterns to emerge (i.e. diagonal stripes and bi-directional lanes). We study under which demand conditions self-organisation occurs and fails, as well as what the impact is of the choices of the different model parameters. In particular, the differences in the weights reflecting the impact of the own and the other classes appear to have a very strong impact on the self-organisation process.},

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the availability, price, and nutritional composition of gluten-free products in retail stores of a Brazilian capital city. Design/methodology/approach – All retail stores listed by the Brazilian Coeliac Association as gluten-free product selling places in the city of Florian?opolis were visited. All available products were catalogued and their labels analysed for nutritional content. Similar gluten-containing products were systematically selected in order to allow comparisons. t-test, analyses of covariance, and cluster analysis were performed, all considering a 5 per cent significance level. Findings – Availability and variety of gluten-free products was limited and prices were high. Cluster analysis found similarities in the nutritional content of gluten-free and conventional food products, suggesting that although raw materials different than wheat were being employed, the composition patterns are the same. Certain advantages in the composition of gluten-free products were observed, regarding mainly calories and sodium, however, protein and dietary fibre values were inferior. Social implications – Results observed may negatively impact diet adherence and stimulate the intake of conventional products with harmful consequences to the quality of life and health of coeliac individuals. Originality/value – This paper conducted a careful evaluation of nutrition composition of gluten-free products from different categories, available in retail stores, which is rare in researches on this topic. Moreover, results call attention to the need of better care in product formulation and dietary guidance for},

abstract = {Street attributes are thought to play an important role in influencing pedestrian route choices. Faced with alternatives, pedestrians have been observed to choose faster, safer, more comfortable, more interesting, or more beautiful routes. Literature on pedestrian route choice has provided methods for assessing the likelihood of such options using discrete choice models. However, route choice estimation, which is data intensive and computationally challenging, remains infrequently deployed in planning mobility analysis practice. Even when coefficients from previous studies are available, operationalizing them in foot-traffic predictions has been rare due to uncertainty involved in the transferability of behavioral effects from one context to another, as well as computational challenges of predicting route choice with custom attributes. This paper explores a simpler method of route choice prediction, implemented in the Urban Network Analysis toolbox, which assigns probabilities to available route options based on distance alone. We compare the accuracy of distance-weighted approaches to the more detailed utility-weighted approach using a large dataset of observed GPS pedestrian traces that include numerous trips between same intersections pairs in downtown San Francisco as a benchmark. Even though a utility-weighted model matches observed pedestrian flows most accurately, a distance-weighted model is only marginally inferior, on average. However, shortest-distance and highest-utility route predictions are both significantly inferior to the utility-weighted and distance-weighted sample-enumeration methods. Our findings suggest that simplified assumptions can be used to predict pedestrian flow in practice with existing software, opening pedestrian flow predictions to a wider range of planning and transportation applications.},

abstract = {To better understand the relationships between walking and the environment, this study tests the feasibility of route choice modeling based on pedestrians' walking behavior. 321 pedestrians were interviewed in two urban neighborhoods (one in New York City and one in Hong Kong) to identify their actual walking routes. Then, we generated potential alternative routes using a modified labeling approach, measured the route environment through environment auditing and secondary data, estimated two multinomial probit models, and compared the results between the two neighborhoods and between the alternative choice models. It is found that route choice models based on revealed preferences could be a valid and complimentary method for assessing the pedestrian environment, and they could help to prioritize or justify investment related to pedestrian infrastructure. In contrast, contingent rating based on stated preference may overestimate the importance of more tangible attributes, such as distance and safety, because pedestrians were often unable to articulate intangible amenities, such as streetscapes and fa{\c{c}}ade designs. However, route choice modeling seems to perform well only when the pedestrian system offers many route alternatives and pedestrians do have experience with multiple routes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

As the use of functional-or performance-based-requirements becomes more popular, there is also an increasing need for methods and tools which can be used to evaluate if these functional requirements are met. This article presents a stochastic model based on the following assumptions: Any pedestrian facility can be modeled as a network of walkway sections. Pedestrian flow in this network can be modeled as a queueing network process, where each pedestrian is treated as a separate flow object, interacting with the other objects. Such a microscopic model is useful because it makes detailed modeling of human behavior possible. This article also presents a simulation tool, of which the main objective is to estimate the relevant performance measures of the pedestrian traffic system.

abstract = {Traffic operations in public walking spaces are to a large extent determined by differences in pedestrian traffic demand and infrastructure supply. Congestion occurs when pedestrian traffic demand exceeds the capacity. In turn, the latter is determined by a number of factors, such as the width of the bottleneck and the wall surface, as well as the interaction behavior of the pedestrians passing the bottleneck. This article discusses experimental findings of microscopic pedestrian behavior in case of bottlenecks. Results for both a narrow bottleneck and a wide bottleneck are discussed and compared to the results of an experiment without a bottleneck. It is shown how pedestrians inside bottlenecks effectively form layers or trails, the distance between which is approximately 45 cm. This is less than the effective width of a single pedestrian, which is around 55 cm. The layers are thus overlapping, a phenomenon which is referred to as the "zipper" effect. The pedestrians within these layers follow each other at 1.3 seconds, irrespective of the considered experiment. For the narrow bottleneck case (width of one meter) two layers are formed; for the wide bottleneck case (width of two meters), four or five layers are formed, although the life span of these layers is rather small. The zipper effect causes the capacity of the bottleneck to increase in a stepwise fashion with the width of the bottleneck, at least for bottlenecks of moderate width (less than 3 m). This has substantial implications for the design of walking facilities. {\textcopyright} 2005 INFORMS.},

A path size logit model with stochastic route choice generation choice set was used for this model. The results of the model showed that distance, the number of turns, the number of signalized intersections, and distance along links with sidewalks on both sides of the street were significant variables in the route choice model. Turns are found to be equivalent to an additional 32 m, signalized intersections are equivalent to a reduction of 34 m, and travel along streets with sidewalks on both sides of the road is evaluated as 33% shorter than streets with other sidewalk conditions. While the dataset used for this study was relatively small (776 trip observations), these results are consistent with other pedestrian route choice studies which support the viability of using smartphone GPS data for future pedestrian route choice studies.},

Although ANN models have been developed rapidly and widely adopted in various fields in the last three decades, their application to predict human decision-making in pedestrian flows is limited, because the video clip technology used to collect pedestrian movement data in crowded conditions is still primitive. Data collection must be carried out manually or semi-manually, which requires extensive resources and is time consuming. This study adopts a semi-manual approach to extract data from video clips to capture the route choice behaviour of travellers, and then applies an ANN to mimic such decision-making.

abstract = {This paper intends to find out which parameters have the highest influence on bicyclists' route-choice-behaviour and how they contribute. There are many attributes considered throughout different studies that are favoured by cyclists. The attributes are the basis for generating a function which predicts the route choice of cyclists. The paper aims at making a comparison between distance-based routes and attribute-based routes. The model for creating the bicycle route choice program is based on the network model of Norrk{\"{o}}ping, Sweden. The preferred attributes of the model each assign a weight in the cost function of the model for each link of the urban network. The algorithm of the lowest cost function route searches the shortest path in terms of assigned link costs over the whole network. For comparing the results of the cost function and the shortest route (between an origin-destination), the model has a shortest path finding algorithm between different Origin and Destination pairs implemented. It has been viewed that around 25% of all cumulative routes do not show any distance differences between the shortest path distance and attributes based solution. With the used weights of the Standard scenario, it can be seen that the trade-off between shortest distance and safety respectively comfort can be optimized, fulfilling both criteria (distance and safety/comfort).},

abstract = {Existing knowledge on the impact of built environment (BE) on route choice behaviour is doubtful due to an unresolved tension between two schools of thought. One represented BE geographically and found that most people tend to choose the shortest route. The other represented BE topologically and showed that least directional change is a key determinant of route choice. How do pedestrians make a trade-off between these two factors in route choice? This question is answered using walking route data of 178 pedestrians in Brisbane, Australia. Their reported routes were examined against the corresponding shortest path and least directional change routes using the percent overlap method. The effects of 25 additional BE factors were also estimated in a conditional logit model. The results reveal that: (a) Together distance and direction are likely to explain 53 of route choice decisions; (b) Individually, distance and direction are likely to explain 34 and 46 of route choice decisions respectively; (c) 28 of the chosen routes satisfied both distance and direction criteria. These findings confirm the claims of both schools, but also point that the least directional change route is a preferred option, and that pedestrians tend to minimise both criteria if they can.},
